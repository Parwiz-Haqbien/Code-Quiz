## Description
In this repository, I develop a timed quiz on JavaScript principles that features a high scores leaderboard.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Click 'Start' to begin the quiz. Correct answers add time, incorrect answers subtract time. The quiz ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero. Save your score with your initials. View saved scores on the leaderboard with 'View Highscores'.
